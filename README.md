This project is the first of many for the future of a software dev company that I dream of running for one of my goals for my life.

This is a tower defence game that I intent on sticking with and working on, regardless of support from others.
The goal here is to have a good idea of what working with a large group of talented and passionate people on a project that will (probably) not offer ANY pay.

The primary directive is to familiarize myself and the group with making a game, as well as creating and maintaining a large software project, including the design process.
The secondary directive is to give talented tower defence players the opportunity to play a game that doesnt require any real money at all to progress; and will ONLY reflect skill.
The tertiary directive is to make a fun game that people will remember as a model for good game design, and a design philosophy that will hopefully change the way people think about videogames; to have fun!
